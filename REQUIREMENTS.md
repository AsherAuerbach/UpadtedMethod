- **REQ-002**: Handle process privilege escalation scenarios
- **REQ-003**: Validate process integrity before injection
- **REQ-004**: Graceful error handling for injection failures

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```powershell
# Must successfully inject into test processes
.\injector\inject.py --target notepad.exe --dll dll-hook\build\Release\hook.dll
# Should handle permission errors gracefully
.\injector\inject.py --target system_process.exe --safe-mode
```

#### 2. API Hooking Framework

- **REQ-006**: Hook keyboard/mouse input APIs for testing input control
- **REQ-007**: Hook file system APIs to test file access restrictions
- **REQ-008**: Implement unhooking mechanisms for clean teardown

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```cpp
// Must successfully hook these APIs
BOOL HookWindowAPIs();     // SetFocus, SetWindowPos, BringWindowToTop
BOOL HookInputAPIs();      // GetKeyboardState, GetCursorPos
BOOL HookFileSystemAPIs(); // CreateFile, ReadFile, WriteFile
BOOL UnhookAllAPIs();      // Clean teardown
```

#### 3. Security Mechanism Testing
