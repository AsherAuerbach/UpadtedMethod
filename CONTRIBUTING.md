# Contributing to UpadtedMethod

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this security research project! This guide will help you understand our development process and standards.

## üéØ Project Purpose

**UpadtedMethod** is a security research tool designed to test and understand Respondus LockDown Browser security mechanisms through DLL injection and API hooking techniques. This is purely for **educational and research purposes**.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This project is for authorized security testing and research only. Contributors must understand and agree to use this tool responsibly and ethically.

- Git
- PowerShell 5.1+ or 7+

### Initial Setup
```powershell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AsherAuerbach/UpadtedMethod.git
cd UpadtedMethod

# Install all development dependencies
.\build.ps1 install-deps -All

# Build and test
.\build.ps1 build
.\build.ps1 test
```

## üìã Development Standards

### Code Quality Requirements

**Python Code Standards**
- ‚úÖ **Type hints required** for all functions and methods
- ‚úÖ **Docstrings required** for all public functions
- ‚úÖ **Error handling** with specific exception types
- ‚úÖ **Ruff formatting** and linting compliance
- ‚úÖ **Tests required** for all new functionality
- ‚úÖ **Logging setup required** in every Python file with file + console output
- ‚úÖ **Exception logging** with complete stack traces mandatory

**C++ Code Standards**
- ‚úÖ **Modern C++17** features and patterns
- ‚úÖ **RAII** and smart pointers for memory management
- ‚úÖ **Minimal external dependencies** (Windows API preferred)
- ‚úÖ **Const correctness** and type safety
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive error handling**
- ‚úÖ **Logging implementation** in every source file (OutputDebugString + file logging)
- ‚úÖ **Exception logging** with context and call stack information

**Testing Requirements**
- ‚úÖ **Unit tests** for all new features
- ‚úÖ **Integration tests** for DLL injection workflows
- ‚úÖ **Error case testing** (not just happy paths)
- ‚úÖ **PowerShell test scripts** for build processes
- ‚úÖ **Safe testing practices** (use SafeMode when possible)

## üîß Development Workflow

### 1. Issue-Driven Development
- Create or assign yourself to an issue
- Use descriptive branch names: `feature/window-focus-testing`, `fix/dll-injection-error`
- Reference issues in commit messages: `Fix #123: Add process validation`

### 2. Feature Development Process
```
1. Design üìã ‚Üí Plan the security test/feature
2. Implement üíª ‚Üí Write focused, typed code
3. Test üß™ ‚Üí Create comprehensive tests
4. Document üìñ ‚Üí Update README/comments
5. Review üëÄ ‚Üí Self-review and cleanup
```

### 3. Commit Standards
```bash
# Good commit messages
git commit -m "feat: add window focus control testing hooks"
git commit -m "fix: handle process termination edge cases"
git commit -m "test: add DLL injection failure scenarios"
git commit -m "docs: update API hooking documentation"

# Use conventional commits format
# type(scope): description
# Types: feat, fix, docs, test, refactor, chore
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests
```powershell
# Run all tests
.\build.ps1 test

# Run specific test suites
.\tests\test-dll-build.ps1
.\tests\test-env-setup.ps1
.\tests\test-injector.ps1 -SafeMode

# Run tests with fixes
.\build.ps1 test -Clean
```

### Writing Tests

**Python Tests**
```python
import pytest
from typing import List
from injector.dll_injector import DLLInjector

def test_process_validation_with_valid_pid() -> None:
    """Test process validation with existing process."""
    injector = DLLInjector()
    # Use current process as safe test
    current_pid = os.getpid()

    result = injector.validate_process(current_pid)
    assert result is True

def test_process_validation_with_invalid_pid() -> None:
    """Test process validation with non-existent process."""
    injector = DLLInjector()

    with pytest.raises(ProcessNotFoundError):
        injector.validate_process(99999)
```

**PowerShell Tests**
```powershell
function Test-DLLInjectionSafety {
    # Test with safe target (notepad)
    $testProcess = Start-Process notepad -PassThru
    try {
        $result = Test-InjectionCapability -ProcessId $testProcess.Id
        Assert-True $result.CanAttach "Should be able to attach to test process"
    } finally {
        $testProcess.Kill()
    }
}
```

## üìù Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation

**Python Logging Example**
```python
import logging
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Optional

# Required logging setup at top of every Python file
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def hook_window_focus(target_hwnd: int) -> bool:
    """Install hooks to test window focus control mechanisms.

    This function installs API hooks for SetFocus, SetWindowPos, and
    BringWindowToTop to test how LockDown Browser enforces window focus.

    Args:
        target_hwnd: Handle to the target window

    Returns:
        True if hooks installed successfully, False otherwise

    Raises:
        PermissionError: If insufficient privileges for hooking
        WindowNotFoundError: If target window doesn't exist

    Security Context:
        Tests the effectiveness of focus enforcement mechanisms
        in educational software security systems.
    """
    logger.info(f"Attempting to install window focus hooks for HWND: {target_hwnd}")

    try:
        # Hook installation logic here
        result = install_focus_hooks(target_hwnd)

        if result:
            logger.info(f"Successfully installed focus hooks for HWND: {target_hwnd}")
        else:
            logger.warning(f"Failed to install focus hooks for HWND: {target_hwnd}")

        return result

    except PermissionError as e:
        logger.error(f"Permission denied installing hooks for HWND {target_hwnd}: {str(e)}",
                    exc_info=True, stack_info=True)
        raise
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Unexpected error installing hooks for HWND {target_hwnd}: {str(e)}",
                    exc_info=True, stack_info=True)

**C++ Logging Example**
```cpp
#include "logging.h"

// Required at top of every C++ source file
static const char* MODULE_NAME = "WindowHooks";

BOOL InstallWindowFocusHooks(HWND targetHwnd) {
    LOG_INFO(std::format("Attempting to install window focus hooks for HWND: {}",
                        reinterpret_cast<uintptr_t>(targetHwnd)));

    try {
        // Hook installation logic here
        BOOL result = SetWindowsHookEx(/* parameters */);

        if (result) {
            LOG_INFO(std::format("Successfully installed focus hooks for HWND: {}",
                               reinterpret_cast<uintptr_t>(targetHwnd)));
        } else {
            DWORD error = GetLastError();
            LOG_ERROR(std::format("Failed to install focus hooks for HWND: {} (Error: {})",
                                reinterpret_cast<uintptr_t>(targetHwnd), error));
        }

        return result;

    } catch (const std::exception& e) {
        LOG_EXCEPTION(std::format("Exception installing hooks for HWND: {}",
                                reinterpret_cast<uintptr_t>(targetHwnd)), e);
        return FALSE;
